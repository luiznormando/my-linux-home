# my-linux-home
My Linux Home with very basic and initial configuration.

*Written in English for an universal comprehension.*

## Fonts
To install specific TTF fonts files, I found two options:
- you can install it at '.fonts' folder, for example '.fonts/computer-modern/*.ttf' and it will be available for the user only; or
- you can install it at '/usr/share/fonts/', for example '/usr/share/fonts/computer-modern/*.ttf' and it will be available for all users;

Any one of these directories will be visible for all programs that uses fonts, like Gimp and LibreOffice.

#### About
The idea here is to hold configuration files for softwares installed accross my Linux machines. Sometimes I find and I like a setup and if it's not saved (a.k.a. 'commited') I forget and I loose it. It frequently happens with 'dot' files (.bashrc, .profile, .gitconfig, .viminfo, .wget-hsts, etc) and 'dot' folders (.config, .fonts, .local, .pki, etc).

The files and folders saved here uses the word **dot** instead of a single **.** strictly for a faster tracking.
