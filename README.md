# my-linux-home
My Linux Home with very basic and initial configuration.

*Written in English for an universal comprehension.*

## About
The idea here is to hold configuration files for softwares installed accross my Linux machines. Sometimes I find and I like a setup and if it's not saved (a.k.a. 'commited') I forget and I loose it. It frequently happens with 'dot' files (.bashrc, .profile, .gitconfig, .viminfo, .wget-hsts, etc) and 'dot' folders (.config, .fonts, .local, .pki, etc).

The files and folders saved here uses the word **dot** instead of a single **.** strictly for a faster tracking.
